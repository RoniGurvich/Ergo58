# Printable Files

You can find the printable files on the [release page](https://github.com/RoniGurvich/Ergo58/releases/tag/latest).

Note that Lily58 comes with a default MX spacing, release files also contain printable files for the slightly smaller
choc
spacing variant from typeractive.xyz.

# Case Parts

Each side of the case includes two printable parts:

- Keyboard housing which keeps the keyboard in place and adds wrist support
- A stand that holds the keyboard and housing at the defined ergonomic angles.

A third - optional printable part is the screen cover.
